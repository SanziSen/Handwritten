# Handwritten
Handwritten is a Machine Learning Model used to learn from the load_digits dataset from sklearn.datasets to train, test, analyse and predict handwritten numbers from the available data.

Here, we try to train our model usng the concepts of MultClass Logistic Regression to predict the actual numbers from their handwritten images, we use the load_digits dataset from sklearn library, furthermore, we also use the confusion matrix to find the accuracy and precision of our model, we also plot a heatmap to analyse our model and its confusion matrix.
